				<h1>Maverick Oleson</h1>
				<p>
					Hello and welcome. I am Maverick Oleson. This is my portfolio website.
					I made it solely by myself. It presents my skillset, current beliefs,
					career thus far, and projects. Click any of the tiles to learn about
					these things.
					<br />
					<br />
					If you're wondering what actually I did to make this, I made this in
					React JS. I used a system of components, used sass styling, used
					conditional rendering, tested it for responsiveness on my phone, made
					my own svgs, came up with the color scheme on my own, and painfully
					learned and implemented Three JS, a WebGL framework, to make the 3d
					graphics in the career page.
					<br />
					<br />I can also work in Node JS, and have rigorously dealt with
					backend authentication and database managing, such as mongoDB and
					Google Firebase. I have my MTA Web Development Fundamentals
					certificate and my CIW Javascript Specialist certificate.
					<br />
					<br />
					If you want to hire me for any front end web development work, or
					javascript work, I'll probably be up for the job. Just ask!
					<br />
					<br />
					My email is: MaverickOleson@gmail.com
					<br />
					<br />
					And my Github is: MaverickOleson
					<br />
					<br />I can guarantee you a website that looks as good, if not, better
					than this one. Also, here is the link for the github of this website:
