                My heart was stolen by a blind pickpocket
                In the deep city streets in the summer of 2012
                And I never even saw her face
                My dreams were shattered like a stained glass window
                Jesus in Pieces! I believe I threw a brick right through Him
                But my memory could not be saved
                It just seems unlikely that it's me who was to blame
                So I bookmark my DSM 'cause I need to remember my place
                This is not enough
                This is not enough to prove it yet
                No, I need to hit the bottom
                This is not enough
                This is not enough to prove it yet
                No, I need to hit the bottom
                (Gotta get to the bottom of this)
                (Gotta get to the bottom of this)
                (Gotta get to the bottom of this)
                Take you with me
                My soul was crushed like a tall boy
                Underneath the boots on the curb
                And I'm still picking up my molars
                And putting them back in my face
                My name was soiled by a last call spill
                With a backwash swill and the blackout killed me
                Sober on impact from a fall from grace
                Take the road on higher ground
                And tell me "don't look down! You'll fall and break your back."
                But that just reminds me how
            </main>
        </div>
    )
}
