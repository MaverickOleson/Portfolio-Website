                <h1>Portfolio Website by<br />Maverick Oleson</h1>
                <p>Hello and welcome. I am Maverick Oleson. This is my portfolio website. I made it solely by myself. It presents my skillset, beliefs, career thus far, and projects. Click any of the tiles to learn about these things.<br /><br />If you're wondering what actually I did to make this, I made this in React JS. I used a system of components, used sass styling, used conditional rendering, tested it for responsiveness on my phone, made my own svgs, came up with the color scheme on my own, and painfully learned and implemented Three JS, a WebGL framework, to make the 3d graphics in the career page.<br /><br />I can also work in Node JS, although I'm a bit of rookie, and I know how to use MongoDB. I am currently working towards getting my CIW certification as well.<br /><br />If you want to hire me for any front end web development work, I'll most likely be up for the job!<br /><br />My email is: MaverickOleson@gmail.com<br /><br />And my Github is: Moleso587587<br /><br />I can guarantee you a website that looks as good, if not, better than this one. Also... this is the link to the github for this website:<br /><br />https://github.com/Moleso587587/Portfolio-Work-In-Progress</p>
